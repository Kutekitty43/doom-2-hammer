# doom-2-hammer
## A simple python program that converts Doom Map Units to Hammer Units.


This is a simple program I made that converts Doom Map Units to Hammer Units (Source Engine), and vice versa. It was meant to automate the calculations I was having to repeatedly punch into my calculator while working on my full conversion of My**house**.wad.


All you do is select your conversion, enter the number of units, and then hit "Convert!" The program does the rest for you.


Unit values and conversions are as follows:
1 Doom Map unit = 1.2 inches (derived from the [Doom Wiki](https://doom.fandom.com/wiki/Map_unit) stating that 32 map units are roughly equal to 1 meter)

1 Hammer Unit =  0.75 inches (derived from the [Valve Developer Wiki](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Dimensions_(Half-Life_2_and_Counter-Strike:_Source)) stating that 16 Hammer Units is typically equal to 1 foot)

h=d/0.625 and d=h*0.625 (From calculations I did myself)
